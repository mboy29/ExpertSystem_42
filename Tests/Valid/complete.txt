# Implication rules
A + (B | C) => D            # A and (B or C) implies D
!B => E                     # Not B implies E
A + B => C                  # A and B implies C
A | (B + C) => D            # A or (B and C) implies D
A ^ B => E                  # A xor B implies E
A + B <=> C                 # A and B if and only if C
(A + B) | C => D            # (A and B) or C implies D
!(A + B) => !C              # Not (A and B) implies not C
A + (B ^ C) => D            # A and (B xor C) implies D

A + (B ^ C) + !B | (A | C) => D # Simplefied (A + (B ^ C) + !B) | (A | C) => D

(V ^ W ) + (S | B) => X
